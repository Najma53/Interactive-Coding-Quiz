# Interactive-Coding-Quiz

As a bootcamp student, we are required to build a coding quiz which is suppose to be interactive. This project involved us to use javaScript to write the code as well as traverse the DOM.

# Description

These are the criteria given to us to create the quiz.

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
* Questions contain buttons for each answer.

* When answer is clicked, the next question appears

* If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

* When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

# Getting started

Step 1

I created a new repository on my GitHub account and clone it to my computer using git clone command.

Then I deployed it by using the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.

I Navigated to my GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

On the Settings page, scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as my source.

This led to my webpage viral https://najma53.github.io/Interactive-Coding-Quiz
My git hub repository is https://github.com/Najma53/Interactive-Coding-Quiz

Step 2

Pseudocodong, done during office hours and outside. A nice flow chart was created by one of our class fellow, Hussain 

Step 3

Watched few u tubes video and then started writing the code following the video

Step 4
Debugging, never got around doing it, my quiz is not working, hopefully will get around doing it soon. Should have just done for loop, iterate through the 4 questions and then  pushed the results up.

# Conclusion

A nice project, found it more challenging than everything I have done so far. Will have to read up and practice traversing the DOM and redo this assignment.
